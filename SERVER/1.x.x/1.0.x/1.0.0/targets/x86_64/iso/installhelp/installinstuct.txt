                    1b. Select "WNU OS Server 1.0.0 (INSTALL) (WIP)" to start the installation process.

                    4e. If they don't show up, of you want to follow the Instructions here, Follow the following steps:
                2a. You will see a Propmt:

                    2b. Type in 'fdisk -l' to list the available disks.
                    2c. It Should Say The Following:
                        NO DISK FOUND AT HARDWARE
                    NOTICE: like TempleOS, WNU OS SERVER 1.0.0, The OS runs at Ring 0, which is the KERNEL. so everything you do WRONG is YOUR FAULT. not OURS. So READ CAREFULLY.
                3a. So If It Shows soemthing, It Might Be a other OS, please in your VM or Server, or Workstation, BOOT to it, AND BACKUP YOUR DATA. because Installing WNU OS SERVER 1.0.0 WILL DELETE ALL DATA ON THE DISK.
                    3b. After Backing up your data, Reboot the ISO/Installation Media, and go back to the 'root@install:~#' prompt.
                    now type in the following command:
                        fdisk /dev/main
                    3c. Now DELETE ALL PARTITIONS ON THE DISK. (THIS WILL DELETE ALL DATA ON THE DISK, SO MAKE SURE YOU BACKED UP YOUR DATA)
                    3d. Now Create a New Partition, Make it PRIMARY, and MAKE IT BOOTABLE.
                    3e. Now Write the changes to the disk and exit fdisk.
                4a. The Filesystem will be The UNIX Filesystem (UNFS), which is a simple filesystem made for WNU OS.
                    4b. Now Format the Partition with UNFS:
                        mkfs.unfs /dev/main1
                    4c. Now Mount the Partition to /mnt:
                        mount /dev/main1 /mnt
                5a. Now We'll Install The Main System files to the disk.
                    5b. Type in the Following command:
                        cp -r ~/filesystem/* {HARDWARE_DISK_MOUNT_POINT}
                    5c. This will copy all the files to the disk.
                    5d. Now Install the Bootloader (GRUB):
                        grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/main
                    5e. Now Install the PACMAN Package Manager:
                        cp ~/pacman/* {HARDWARE_DISK_MOUNT_POINT}/usr/bin
                6a. Now Install The BOOTLOADER (CRITAL STEP IF YOU DO THIS WRONG, REINSTALL EVERYTHING)
                    6b. Type in the following command:
                        grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/main
                    6c. This will install GRUB to the disk.
