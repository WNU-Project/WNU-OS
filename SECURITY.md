### üìä Severity Classification

We classify vulnerabilities using the following categories:

| Severity | Description | Response Time | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, privilege escalation | 24-48 hours | Authentication bypass, system compromise |
| **High** | Significant security impact | 3-7 days | Local privilege escalation, data exposure |
| **Medium** | Moderate security impact | 1-2 weeks | Information disclosure, denial of service |
| **Low** | Minor security impact | 2-4 weeks | Minor information leaks, edge case issues |

### üîÑ Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** - We'll acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Investigation** - Security team will investigate and validate the report
3. **Assessment** - We'll assess the impact and assign severity level
4. **Fix Development** - Develop and test security patch
5. **Disclosure** - Coordinate responsible disclosure timeline
6. **Release** - Security update released with advisory

### üìÖ Timeline Expectations

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Updates**: Every 72 hours during investigation
